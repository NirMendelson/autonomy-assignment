# 💪 Home Assignment: Build an i18n Agent for a React App

Welcome! As part of this assignment, you'll demonstrate your ability to:

- Work with a **React codebase**
- Build a **Python agent**
- Interface with **LLM APIs**

---

## 📜 The Task

You're provided with a simple React app. Your task is **not** to manually refactor it for internationalization.

Instead, you will **build an automated agent in Python** that adds internationalization

---

## 🧠 AI Agent Behavior

Your agent must work end-to-end without human intervention

You **must not** use LLM tools manually to do the refactor. The goal is to **automate this process through your Python agent**.

---

## 🧑‍💻 OpenAI API Key

Alongside this repository you should get a key

```

```

If you did not get a valid key to use, please get in touch.

---

## 📹 Loom Video

As part of your submission, please record a **short Loom video (2–5 minutes)** walking us through:

- Your approach and reasoning
- How the agent works
- A quick demo of it in action

---

## ✅ Submission Checklist

- [ ] Python agent code (self-contained and runnable)
- [ ] Updated React project with i18n changes applied by the agent
- [ ] Short Loom video link

---

## ⏱️ Scope & Expectations

We don't expect perfection — we’re looking for:
- A thoughtful approach
- Basic LLM interaction
- Sensible automation
- Clean, readable code

You can use any Python tools, packages, or abstractions you find helpful.

You have 3 days for this task, good luck!
